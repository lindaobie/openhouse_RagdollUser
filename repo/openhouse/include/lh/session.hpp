// lh::Session — the public face of the lh driver runtime (liblh).
//
// A Session owns one tracking universe: it reads devices (live USB or a recorded
// .lhraw capture), runs one tracker per device on top of a room map that every
// device shares, decodes controller input, and keeps the room map on disk.
//
// Frontends (the 3D visualizer, lhtool, and later the SteamVR driver) only talk to
// this header. Everything here is plain data; no Eigen/transport types leak out.
//
// Thread safety: lifecycle calls (Start/Stop/destruction) are owner-thread
// operations. While running, data/control methods may be called concurrently.
// Snapshot() returns a consistent copy; PollEvents() drains the event queue.

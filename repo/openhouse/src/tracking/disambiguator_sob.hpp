// Lighthouse 2.0 ("sync on beam", SOB) disambiguator: LH2 light words -> optical frames.
//
// After vortex::CDisambiguatorSyncOnBeam (vtable 0x4710f8; beam word 0x3207e0, sensor
// word 0x31e610, frame builder 0x31f340). An LH2 base has no sync flash: each of its
// channels (0-15) spins at its own rate (period table 0x1a1ce0, 48 MHz ticks) and the
// device's FPGA, decoding the beam's LFSR, reports
//  * a beam word once per revolution, at a fixed rotor phase: the revolution's sync,
//    carrying one OOTX bit (bit 26);
//  * a sensor word per hit: sensor id and the time the beam crossed it.
// A hit's angle is 2*pi*(t - sync)/period. Each revolution sweeps the device twice, with
// two planes tilted -/+30 deg: hits in the first half turn are plane 0 (frame axis 0),
// in the second plane 1 (axis 1). The gen2 measurement model (lighthouse_model.hpp,
// Lh2Angle) maps them to a position.
//
// Frames are built per revolution when the next beam word arrives (the right sync is
// then measured), or once the revolution is overdue. All bases sweep at once (unlike LH1's
// turns), so frames of different channels overlap in time while the filter only takes
// them in time order (it drops a frame older than the last one applied): frames are held
// and released in order of their first hit, kHold behind the newest word seen.

// Head-mounted displays through the original driver ("hybrid"): our driver tracks every
// device, but a headset's display (distortion, projection, direct mode, IPD, proximity,
// camera, audio) comes from the user's installed stock driver_lighthouse, loaded at run
// time from the copy the installer kept (driver_lighthouse.so.stock). Nothing of it is
// shipped with this project.
//
// The stock provider gets a driver context whose IVRServerDriverHost is a proxy:
//  * TrackedDeviceAdded: only head-mounted displays reach the real host; everything else
//    the stock driver finds is ours already and is swallowed (reported as added).
//  * TrackedDevicePoseUpdated for its headset: dropped once ours publishes the pose (our
//    tracking, our room frame); every other call passes through.
//  * PollNextEvent: the host's events reach both drivers (ours polls the host and hands
//    the stock driver a copy), so neither steals the other's.
// Its IVRProperties is a proxy too: the stock driver's writes of the headset's universe
// are dropped (ours sets it); every other property passes.
// Of the stock provider's standby calls only LeaveStandby is forwarded (it turns the
// headset's panels back on); EnterStandby would power off controllers it doesn't own
// here. The headset's own device calls are forwarded.

// Room solver: joint least-squares estimate of all base station poses.
//
// Devices contribute keyframes: short windows (one LH1 cycle) in which a device saw
// at least two base stations with both sweep axes, together with the device's filter
// pose and velocity. The solver estimates
//     world_from_base (every base except the origin, which fixes the gauge)
//     world_from_device_k (one pose per keyframe)
// by minimizing the LH1 sweep-angle residuals of every sample (the same
// CSensorPositionAngular model as the filter, with each base's factory calibration),
// with a robust loss. This is a small bundle adjustment: the keyframe poses are
// eliminated (Schur), so cost grows linearly with the number of keyframes.
//
// Compared with following one filter's alternate-base estimate, every sample from
// every device and position constrains the room, the device poses are re-estimated
// instead of trusted, and outliers are down-weighted.
